For my CS50 final project I built a web app for temporary file uploading with python and flask web framework, your files are uploaded with a unique random USER ID, you can access to each  files on any device just with this number.

It's designed to be a fast and lightweight file uploading solution, either to be deployed on a dedicated web server or to be used locally taking advantage of wireless speeds.
