# Magic Sender
For my CS50 final project I built a web app for temporary file uploading with python and flask web framework, your files are uploaded with an unique randomly generated USER ID, you can access to each  files on any device just with this number.

It's designed to be a fast and lightweight file uploading solution, either to be deployed on a dedicated web server or to be used locally taking advantage of wireless high speeds.
